As shown in Fig.(b), small bins sizes might introduce artifacts. Fig.(b) and Fig.(c) are examples of histograms with two different bin sizes. Another great way to visualize such distribution is to use a cumulative representation, as show in Fig.(d), in which the y-axis represents the number of data points with values greater than y.  \n",
